# On Beginnings

There’s something awkward about starting a blog. The first entry feels like it should carry weight, as if it sets the tone for everything that comes after. But maybe it’s simpler: a marker in time, proof that I pressed publish.

I’ve been circling around what this space should be. A logbook? A sketchpad for unfinished ideas? A place to park the pieces that don’t quite fit on Instagram or in the shop? Maybe it will be all of that.

What I know is that I like seeing the messy middle—other people’s process, not just their polished endings. This blog will likely skew that way: fragments, notes, the occasional finished report, and some wandering thoughts on art, tools, and trying to get work across the finish line.

If you’re reading this, you’ve caught the very start. Let’s see where it goes.
